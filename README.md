# war
This is an implementation of the basic card game,
[war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). This game is VERY boring,
so may I suggest that you run war_simulation.rb instead of game_of_war.rb. The
simulation runs until the game is over (which takes less than a second), as
opposed to game_of_war.rb, which is just a virtual version of this very long and
very boring card game, but without the thrill of picking up the cards following
the victory of a "war" occurrence.

To run the simulation, download the directory, and in the directory, run:

    $ ruby war_simulation.rb

To run the actual game (that is, if for some reason you *actually* want to play), run:

    $ ruby game_of_war.rb

Have fun!
