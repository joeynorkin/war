# war
This is an implementation of the basic card game, war. This is very boring, so
might I suggest that you run war_simulation.rb instead of game_of_war.rb. The
simulation runs until the game is over, where as game_of_war.rb is like playing
this very boring card game, but without the thrill of picking of the cards
following a victory.

To run the simulation, download the directory, and in the directory, enter:
    
    ruby war_simulation.rb

To run the actual game (that is if for some reason you want to play), enter:

    ruby game_of_war.rb

Have fun!
